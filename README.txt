I coded an e-commerce site with .net core. I used the user registration process (google, facebook and the registration form for the site optional), admin and normal user accounts in it. In the e-commerce site, user information, role information, products, categories are kept in the database.

Virtual pos integration is also available. I used Iyzipay for this.
